How It Works

Schedule: GitHub Actions triggers every 30 minutes (and supports manual workflow_dispatch).

Data: Fetches last 6 candles (30â€¯min interval) for each coin via TwelveData.

Price Alerts: Compares current vs. previous close; triggers Pump/Dump alerts when thresholds are met.

Volatility Alerts: Fetches ATR(14) and flags True Range spikes â‰¥1.2Ã—ATR.

Notifications: Sends Telegram messages with emoji, text, and mini price charts.

Test Mode: On manual runs, reports all current changes and ATR without filtering.

Customize
